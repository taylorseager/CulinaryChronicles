Place 1-2 cups of white flour on clean counter, add 1/4-1/2 of the dough onto the flour. Slowly kneed the flour into the dough evenly until it no longer sticks to the counter (be careful not to over kneed). Check the underneath of the dough frequently to make sure it doesn't stick to the counter. Roll out to desired depth with rolling pin. Transfer to drying place. After approx 2-3 hours, cut dough into desired shapes. The longer the dough drys, the better they taste!",
